# EZ_MusicSystem
A basic student level music system using C++

This is a basic music system with four functions:
1. Insert song at the beginning of the music track list
2. Insert song at the end of the music track list
3. Display sorted music track list in ascending order based on index number
NOTE: The index number will based on the insertion sequences

As for the Music Track list system, I implemented struct and linked list to display it. Full code are provided in "EZ_Music_System.cpp".
I apply some algorithm similar to selection sort to sort the music track list in ascending order.

There is no VALIDATION in this code, you are required to add the validation by yourselves.
